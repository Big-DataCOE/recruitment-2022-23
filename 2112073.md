##EXPERIENCE:
 
It was fun and definitely a learning experience throughout the probation.
The tasks allocated to us really helped in gaining an experience that wouldn't have been possible in any other way.
The presentation task also helped me in knowing how it feels being in those shoes. And I loved it.
I really want to be a part of this for much longer.
